        <p>Steve is a MCS Student at UIUC. He enjoys sports and playing video games in his free time. The rest of this text is just a placeholder as I did not know what to add here. So please imagine something creative is written and just react as if you are flabbergasted by this description.</p>
        <p>I worked with Barcalys in India for 2 years before coming to UIUC as a Salesforce MC Developer.</p>
