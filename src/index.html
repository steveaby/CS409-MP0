So please imagine something creative is written and just react as if you are flabbergasted by this description.</p>

      <a href="src/public/Replica.html" class="button">Example Replica*</a>
      <p class="caveat">*Not sure why this button is not working, maybe a different approach is needed. I was trying this to make it so that when you click the button you can see the exact replica as per the example. This button works when opening the index file manually on your local machine and not with npm start method.</p>
